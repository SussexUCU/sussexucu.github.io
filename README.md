# Open Governance at Sussex Universiy 
Sussex UCU doing github for governance

Welcome all - this is the starting place to make clear and accessible what we are doing to make governance at the University of Sussex more open for the community. 

Published Council papers are availble to all staff and students via login through <a href="https://direct.sussex.ac.uk/page.php?realm=searches&page=committees">Sussex Directt</a>. There are thousands of papers but with no search facility. Until now!

So far we can search ~2400 Council papers, including Council, Strategic Performance and Resource Commitee, Audit & Risk, Audit (disbanded 2017) and Finance (disbanded 2017), and some recent Senate papers. Word searches are not cap sensitive. We can search all file types (rtf, doc, docx, ppt, pptx etc) including (amazingly) scanned pdfs. This is a work in progress. If you want to get involved get in touch. 


<b>How do I do a word search?</b>

At the moment the word search is done on our computers. But whether you are a member of campus unions or not, email Sussex UCU with a reason for your word search we'll consider running it. So far we have searched for 'covenant', 'racism', 'block j', 'saat', 'ucu', 'unite' and 'unison' and this is helping our supporting our work on the Combined Joint Negotiating Committee, in our presentations to Council and our work on the Race Equality Charter committee.

<b>Where can I see search results?</b>

You can see the results in spreadsheets in each folder here. Open the .ods (Open Office Spreadsheets)in Excel to view list of the files. We have added links, but have to do this by hand so this is not always complete.

<b>I'm on UEG or Council: how can I use this facility?</b>

We're happy to share our work. See developer pages or contact Sussex UCU with a key word search and a reason and we'll run it.
