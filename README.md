# Open Governance at the University of Sussex
<i>Sussex UCU go GitHub for governance</i>

<b>Welcome</b>. This is the starting place to make clear and accessible our ongoing work to promote open governance at the University of Sussex. 

- Published Council papers are available to all staff and students via login through <a href="https://direct.sussex.ac.uk/page.php?realm=searches&page=committees">Sussex Direct</a>. There are thousands of papers but no search facility, making it really difficult to find relevant papers... until now!

- So far we can search ~2400 Council papers, including Strategic Performance and Resource, Audit & Risk and Finance (committees that advise on strategy and budget) with file types pdf, office and rtf and (amazingly) scanned pdfs. 

<b>Q&As</b>

<b>How do I do a word search?</b>
At the moment the word search is done on our computers. But whether you are a member of campus unions or not, contact <a href= "https://ucusussex.wixsite.com/ucusussex">Sussex UCU</a> with a reason for your word search we'll consider running it. 

<b>Where can I see search results?</b>
Search results are stored on University of Sussex Box storage. We can give access to people with Sussex Box accounts. Get in touch with <a href= "https://ucusussex.wixsite.com/ucusussex">Sussex UCU</a>. 

<b>I'm on UEG or Council - can I use this facility?</b>
Yes. We're happy to share our work. See <a href= "https://github.com/SussexUCU/developer"> ogustools</a> for technical info on how to set up searches. Or contact Sussex UCU with a key word search and a reason and we'll run it.

<b>We're from another UCU branch - can we have one of these? </b>
Absolutely. See <a href= "https://github.com/SussexUCU/developer"> ogustools</a> or get in touch through <a href= "https://ucusussex.wixsite.com/ucusussex">Sussex UCU</a> we'll be very happy to help.

<b>Big shout out</b> to the people working on this and more generally the great work happening with local unions <a href="https://www.sussexstudent.com">USSU</a>, <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/unite/">Unite</a> and <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/unison/">Unison</a>.
