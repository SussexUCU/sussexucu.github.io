Welcome all - this is the starting place to make clear and accessible what we are doing to make governance at the University of Sussex more open for the community.

These files show word searches of ~2400 Council files. Going back to 2006. So far we only have Council, SPRC, Audit & Risk, Audit (disbanded 2017) and Finance (disbanded 2017), and a few Senate papers. Word searches are not cap sensitive. We can search all file types including (amazingly) scanned .pdfs. This is a work in progress. If you want to get involved get in touch. 

<b>What are these files? </b>

- all files are in folders named with the word search
- each file name is the word search and the date we searched, e.g. covenant_2020_06_02, for 'covenant' word search on 2 June 2020
- in the file is name of committee, date of committee meeting, name of file, number of times word appears (some files include links to the original documents)

<b>Why are there different types of files? </b>

- if the file ends in .txt its a load of text (this is the raw output - so a bit difficult to work with but you can open in Excel and use Data, Text to Columns) 
- if the file ends in .ods we have formatted it and you should be able to open with Excel, it includes links to some files too
- we are using .ods so people with Open Office (which is free) can use it as well as people with Excel

<b>How do I view the origial paper? </b>

- if you can open the .ods file you will see we have started to include links to each of the files. If you work or study at Sussex you can then login to Sussex Direct to access the file. 
- at the moment we are adding the links by hand (time consuming) so this work is only partially complete

<b>Can I do a word search? </b>

- we've haven't yet built a dynamic search facility so this site can't yet run searches like google 
- if there's a word search you want then get in touch with a reason and we'll run it

<b>What can I do?</b>

- if you are a UCU branch and want to develop something similar - please visit the developer repository or get in touch :)
- if you are part of the Sussex community but not a developer and want to help, you can help with manually add links while our developers scratch their heads - get in touch :) 
- if you are a developer and have ideas to make this work better (ie links to files automatically included in search results) get in touch :)
- and as above, if there's a word search you want then get in touch with a reason and we'll run it

<b>All ideas to make this better are welcome - thank you for reading to the end. </b>
