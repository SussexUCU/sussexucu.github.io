# Open Governance at Sussex Universiy 
<i>Sussex UCU doing github for governance</i>

<b>Welcome</b>. This is the starting place to make clear and accessible our ongoing work to make governance at the University of Sussex more open for the community. 

Published Council papers are availble to all staff and students via login through <a href="https://direct.sussex.ac.uk/page.php?realm=searches&page=committees">Sussex Direct</a>. There are thousands of papers but no search facility, making it really difficult to find relevant papers, until now!

So far we can search ~2400 Council papers, including Strategic Performance and Resource, Audit & Risk, and Finance. We can search all file types (rtf, doc, docx, ppt, pptx etc) including (amazingly) scanned pdfs. 

<b>How do I do a word search?</b>
At the moment the word search is done on our computers. But whether you are a member of campus unions or not, contact <a href= "https://ucusussex.wixsite.com/ucusussex">Sussex UCU</a> with a reason for your word search we'll consider running it. 

<b>Where can I see search results?</b>
You can see the results of each word search in spreadsheets in folders <a href="https://github.com/SussexUCU/open-governance">here</a>. Go into the folder of the relevant word, open the .ods (Open Office Spreadsheets) in Excel (or similar) to view list of the files. Some have links, but these currently have to be added by hand so are incomplete. 

<b>I'm on UEG or Council: how can I use this facility?</b>
We're happy to share our work. See <a href= "https://github.com/SussexUCU/developer"> developer repo</a> or contact Sussex UCU with a key word search and a reason and we'll run it.

<b>We're a UCU branch - can we have one of these? </b>
Absolutely - get in touch through <a href= "https://ucusussex.wixsite.com/ucusussex">Sussex UCU</a> we'll be very happy to discuss the nuts and bolts.

<b>Big shout out</b> to the developers and the great work happening with local unions <a href="https://www.sussexstudent.com">USSU</a>, <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/unite/">Unite</a>Unite and <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/unison/">Unison</a>.
